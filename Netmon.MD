# Netmon

## Netmon is an easy Windows machine and is recommended on many lists of beginner boxes. While there are different ways to complete this box, I aim for this guide to show the easiest.

### Enumeration

First scanning with NMAP shows open ports on 21, 80, 135, 139, 445 and 5985

I always like to run NMAP with the flags ```-sC -sC -vv``` for basic scripts, service detection and verbose results.
